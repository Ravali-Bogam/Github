                    Biryani is a tasty dish enjoyed by many people.
                     It is made with rice, meat like chicken , and lots of spices. 
                     The rice turns yellow because of a special spice called turmeric.
                      It also has raisins and boiled eggs. Some people add vegetables too.
                       Biryani is cooked in a big pot and it smells really good.
                        It is a special dish in India and people often make it for big celebrations. 
                        It takes a long time to cook, but when it’s ready, it’s very delicious. 
                        Everyone loves to eat biryani because it is so yummy.

                A pizza joke? Never mind, it’s too cheesy. In crust we trust. Pizza is round, 
                but it comes in a square box and we eat it in triangles. Life is full of circles. 
                I pepper-only have eyes for you. Slice, slice, baby. You’ve stolen a pizza my heart. 
                Keep calm and carry out pizza.
